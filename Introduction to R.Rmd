## I. Overview of R's Interface

R's interactive command line will act as a calculator in basic form. 
```{r}
  1 + 1
```

## II. R Basics 

### Comments
Comments are annotations in code to make code easier to understand. Comments are writtine with a '#' in front. To comment out an entire section of code use Ctrl Shift 'C'.

### Assignments
We can assign values to names using the assignment statement: '<-', which is just a less than sign '<' followed by a minus sign '-'.
```{r}
  add <- 1 + 2
  add
```
A shortcut to create the assignment statement is 'Alt' '-'.      

### Functions
A function in R is the name of the function, followed by the parentheses. All of the arguments of the function are contained within the parentheses and can be set by the user.
```{r collapse = TRUE}
  sqrt(2^3)
  sqrt(add)
```

### Data Types
#### 1. Vectors
Tie more than one value to a name by using the *'c'* function, which stands for 'combine.'
```{r}
  vec1 <- c(4.6, 4.8, 5.2, 6.3, 6.8, 7.1, 7.2, 7.4, 7.5, 8.6)
  vec2 <- c('UT', 'IA', 'MN', 'AL', 'WI', 'MN', 'OH', 'IA', 'NY', 'IA')
```

Index vectors by using the square braces [ ].
```{r}
vec2[1:3]
vec2[c(1,3)]
```

There are some functions which can be used on all types of vectors whether it is character or numeric.
```{r eval =FALSE}
  length(vec1)
  length(vec2)  
  class(vec1)
  class(vec2)
```

There are other functions which only make sense to run on a numeric vector.
```{r eval = FALSE}
  mean(vec1)
  var(vec1)
  sum(vec1)
  max(vec1)
```
Transform the type of a vector
```{r eval = FALSE}
as.character(vec1)
as.factor(vec1)
```

Vectors can undergo all sorts of math and manipulations.
```{r eval = FALSE}
vec1+1
vec1*5
rep(1, times = 10)   
rep(vec1, times = 5) 
round(vec1/3, 2)
floor(vec1)
```

#### 2. Matrices
A matrix brings two or more vectors together. There cannot be mixed data types within a matrix, i.e. a matrix is either all numeric or all character.
```{r}
  m1 <- cbind(vec1, vec2) 
  m1 
```

Index a matrix with braces: [rows, columns].
```{r eval = FALSE}
  m1[, 1]
  m1[2, ]
```


#### 3. Data Frames
A data frame can hold all different classes of vectors.
```{r}
  df1 <- data.frame(vec1, vec2)
```

Reference via brackets : dataframe[rows, columns]
```{r eval = FALSE}
  df1[, 1] 
  df1[, 2]
  df1[, 'vec1']
```

Reference columns (variables) using the '$'.
```{r eval = FALSE}
  df1$vec1
  df1$vec2
```

	
#### 4. Lists
A list is a container that can hold almost anything in one of its components. 
```{r}
  l1 <- list(vec1, df1, m1) 
```

Reference a component by using double braces '[[ ]]' and an element within the component with following single braces '[ ].'
```{r eval = FALSE}
  l1[[1]] 
  l1[[2]][2] 
```


### Missing Data
A missing value is represented by an 'NA', which is neither character or numeric. 
```{r}
  vec3 <- c(4.6, 4.8, 5.2, 6.3, 6.8, 7.1, 7.2, 7.4, 7.5, 8.6, NA)
```

Math functions, such as the *'sum'* function, will be unable to compute if there is a missing value in the data. To calculate the sum, we can set the argument na.rm = TRUE, which will remove the missing value from the calculation without removing the missing value from the vector.
```{r collapse = TRUE}
  sum(vec3)
  sum(vec3, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## III. Getting Started with R

### A. Working Directory
A working directory is the path to where your data files are and/or where you want to save your files to.
```{r eval = FALSE}
  getwd()  
  setwd('C:/Users/NYU User/Desktop')  
  dir()
```

### B. Importing Datasets
Read .csv format (comma separated values)
```{r eval = TRUE}
  health <- read.csv('Dataset.csv')    
  health <- read.table('Dataset.csv', sep = ',', header = TRUE) 
```
Read .txt format 
```{r eval =FALSE}
  read.table('Dataset.txt', sep = ' ')
```
### C. Packages
Packages are collections of user written functions.
```{r eval = FALSE}
  install.packages('name of package')
  library(name of package)
```

Use the package *'readr'*, to reading in tabular text data faster than the above functions. Use *'read_table'* when files your data is delimited by spaces, *'read_delim'* when you have other types of delimiters or *'read_csv'* when you have .csv files.
```{r eval = FALSE}
  read_table('Dataset.txt')
  read_delim('Dataset.txt', delim = '\t')
  read_csv('Dataset.csv')  
```


Use the package *'haven'*, to read in SPSS, Stata and SAS files
``` {r eval = FALSE}
  install.packages('haven')
  library(haven)
  read_spss('Dataset.sav')
  read_dta('Dataset.dta')
  read_sas('Dataset.sas7bdat')
```

Use the package *'readxl'* to read in .xls and .xlsx files.
```{r eval = FALSE}
  install.packages('readxl')
  library(readxl)
  read_excel('Dataset.xls', sheet = 1, col_names = TRUE)  
```

### D. Export data file
```{r eval = FALSE}
  write.csv(health, 'health_csv.csv', row.names = FALSE) 
```

Use *'readr'* to export csv files. About twice as fast as write.csv and never exports row names. 
```{r eval = FALSE}
  write_csv(health, 'health_csv.csv')
```

Use *'haven'*, to export both SPSS and Stata files.
```{r eval = FALSE}
  write_spss(health, "health_spss.sav")
  write_dta(health, "health_stata.dta")
```

___
## IV. Dataset Manipulation

### A. Rename Columns (Variables)
```{r collapse = TRUE}
  names(health)
  
  names(health)[5:10] <- c('food', 'smoke', 'exercise', 'happy', 'alcohol', 'doctor')
  names(health)
```

### B. Working with Missing Data
First we need to recode the -1 values to missing, NAs.
```{r collapse = TRUE}
health$age

which(health$age == -1)

health$age[which(health$age == -1 )] <- NA
health$age

is.na(health$age)
table(is.na(health$age))
```

Then to run analysis, like the mean function, we must remember the na.rm = TRUE argument.
```{r collapse = TRUE}
mean(health$age)
mean(health$age, na.rm = TRUE)
```


### C. Compute New Variables 
  	
To create a new variable in a data frame:
```{r}
  health$health_sum <- health$food + health$smoke + 
      health$exercise + health$happy + health$alcohol + health$doctor

health[1:5, 5:11]
```
There are alternative and cleaner methods for summing up variables.
``` {r eval = FALSE}
  rowSums(health[5:10])
  apply(health[, 5:10], 1, sum)
```


### D. Recode Variables
To recode a continuous variable into a categorical variable, first create a new variable and use logical expressions to determine the new values of the new variable.
```{r collapse = TRUE}
  summary(health$age)   		
  
  health$age_cat[health$age <= 32.5] <-'Group 1'
  health$age_cat[health$age > 32.5 & health$age <= 50] <- 'Group 2'
  health$age_cat[health$age > 50] <-'Group 3'
  
  health[1:5, c('age', 'age_cat')]
```

	
### E. Recode Values
To recode values within the same variable, there is recode function in the *'car'* package.
```{r eval = FALSE}
  install.packages('car')
  library(car)
  health$health22 <- recode(health$smoke, '1=5;2=4;3=3;4=2;5=1')
```


### F. Subsets of a Data Frame 
There are several ways to subset the data frame. You can use the square brackets to specify certain rows and columns. The which command can be used to select rows that meet certain criteria. These two methods can be combined, or you can use the *'subset'* function. 
```{r collapse = TRUE}
  health[, c('id', 'gender', 'smoke')]
  
  health[1:3, c('id', 'gender', 'smoke')]  

  which(health$age > 40) 
  which(health$age > 40 & health$age < 50)
  which(health$age < 25 | health$age > 50)  

  sub1 <- health[which(health$age > 40), c('age','smoke')]
  sub2 <- subset(health, age > 40, select=c('age','smoke'))
  
  sub1
```

___
## V. Descriptive Statistics

### A. Basic Statistics
The *'summary function'* is useful in many situations, it can be used to obtain a six number summary of your variables.
```{r collapse = TRUE}
  summary(health) 
  
  summary(health$age)
```

Or you can use individual functions to obtain one value at a time.
```{r collapse = TRUE}
  mean(health$age, na.rm = TRUE)
  median(health$age, na.rm = TRUE)
  sd(health$age, na.rm = TRUE)
  quantile(health$age, na.rm = TRUE)
```


### B.  Frequencies and Cross Tabulations
```{r collapse = TRUE}
  table(health$gender)
  
  prop.table(table(health$gender))  

  table(health$gender, health$age_cat)  

prop.table(margin.table(table(health$gender, health$age_cat), 1))
prop.table(margin.table(table(health$gender, health$age_cat), 2))
```


### C. Correlation 
```{r }
  cor(health[5:9])
  
  plot(health[5:9])
```

___
## VI. Graphics

### Base Graphics
Formula notation is introduced below where you have your dependent variable on the left of the '~' and you have your independent variable(s) on the right side. 
```{r}
  boxplot(health_sum ~ gender, ylab = 'Sum Score', xlab = 'Gender', data = health)   
```


Use the *'par'* function to include more than one graphic in a single window.
```{r}
  par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
  boxplot(food ~ gender, ylab = 'Organic Food in Diet', xlab = 'Gender', data = health)  
  boxplot(smoke ~ gender, ylab = 'Cigarettes per Week', xlab = 'Gender', data = health)  
  boxplot(exercise ~ gender, ylab = 'Exercise', xlab = 'Gender', data = health)  
  boxplot(happy ~ gender, ylab = 'Happiness', xlab = 'Gender', data = health)  
```


```{r}
  par(mfrow = c(3, 2))
  barplot(table(health$gender))
  plot(health$age, ylab = 'Age')
  hist(health$age, col = 'blue', breaks = 20, xlab = 'Age', main = 'Participants')
  boxplot(age ~ gender, data = health, ylab = 'Age')
  plot(smoke ~ food, pch = '*', data = health, ylab = 'Cigarettes per Week')
  plot(jitter(smoke) ~  jitter(food), pch = 20, col = rainbow(30), xlab = 'Organic Food in Diet', ylab = 'Cigarettes per Week', main = 'Healthy Life Style', data = health)
  par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```


### Advanced Graphics with ggplot2
```{r }
  library('ggplot2')
  qplot(x = carat, y = price, color=cut, data = diamonds) 
```

___
## VII. Hypothesis Testing
### Chi-square Test
```{r collapse = TRUE}
  chisq.test(health$gender, health$age_cat)
  
  summary(table(health$gender, health$age_cat))
```

### T-tests
Just by changing the arguments within the *'t.test'* function, we can run a one sample t-test, an independent t-test and a paired t-test. 
```{r collapse = TRUE}
  t.test(health$health_sum, mu=3)
  
  t.test(health_sum ~ gender, data = health)
  
  t.test(health$food, health$smoke, paired = TRUE) 
```

You can access different parts of the output that are stored, such as the t-statistic or p-value.
```{r collapse = TRUE}
  my_ttest <- t.test(health$food, health$smoke, paired = TRUE) 
  summary(my_ttest)
  
  my_ttest$statistic
```

### Linear Regression Model
When you run a regression model, you should save the results to an lm object through use of the assignment statement. This way you will be able to access different parts of the results later on.
```{r collapse = TRUE}
  lm_health <- lm(health_sum ~ age + gender, data = health)
  summary(lm_health)
  
  confint(lm_health)
```

```{r collapse = TRUE}
  par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
  plot(lm_health)
```

### ANOVA 
```{r}
  aov_health <- aov(health_sum ~ state + gender, data = health)
  summary(aov_health)
```
